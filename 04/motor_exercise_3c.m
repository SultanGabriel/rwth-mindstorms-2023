%% Initialize figures
plot_number_face;   % plot calculator face figure
hold on             % hold on flag to plot more plots into the calculator face figure



%% Calculate pointers to plot
% Tips:
% * for line plotting only the start and end point of the line has to be given
% * the rotated pointers can be easily constructed by a complex number (value and phase)
% * the length of the complex vectors should be different for both pointers and less than one
% * note the number zero is located at the coordinates (x,y) = (0,1) or (0,i) respectively
% * take care to use degrees or radian
% * consider only angles which are related to the exact number position. Angles between two
% numbers should be neglected.
